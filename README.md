# Why?

Inventing programming languages is my mission from god.

# Installation

Pogoscript requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) to be installed.

As its still a little bit experimental pogoscript is not in npm yet, but you can still have npm install it for you from the git repo.

    git clone https://github.com/featurist/pogoscript.git
    cd pogoscript
    npm link
