# Stuff to do

* parameters (including optional parameters) should not be allowed to shadow variables in outer scope
* think seriously about requiring `:=` for assignment of already defined variables
* allow indent or new line after operators, `;` and `:`.
* introduce `+=`, `-=`, `&=`, `*=`, `/=`, `|=`.
